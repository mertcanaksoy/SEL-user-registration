--- DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN TEST ---

- Install Python if you didn't
- Download Chrome driver if you didn't. Then extract to a simple directory
- Open an IDE which supports Python (I've used PyCharm)
- Open the test_demoqa.py document, then check the webdriver's path that called executable_path.
It should be (executable_path="C:\Packs\chromedriver.exe") when you open it. That is my driver's path.
Now you have to update this path to your webdriver's actual path.
For example if we assume that your webdriver is in Desktop, path should be like (executable_path="C:\Desktop")
- I've not delete virtual environment. So you can run rest_demoqa.py document directly.
However if we assume that it was deleted somehow, don't worry. You just need to open
your IDE's terminal, then run this script "pip install selenium"
- After all, you can run test_demoqa.py
