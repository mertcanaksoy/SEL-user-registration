--- BRIEF PARAGRAPH ---
Selenium Automation
- First of all, the gender radiobutton selection was hard to me. It was always thrown ElementClickInterceptedException.
I've fixed this issue by used execute_script() and presence_of_element_located() methods
- Also it was hard to tackle datepicker element. Actually I wanted to selected random year, month and days in this element.
But it wasn't possible to select random year because of I cannot scroll the year section to up and down.
So I used a static date
- I couldn't handle the Subjects, State and City Listboxes due to I couldn't find these selectors. These selectors
couldn't be tracked on devtools because they were gone when I tried to track them. You can also check this issue on your browser if you want.

API Testing
- I've never used API testing in my proffessional life. So I've searched about this on internet.
- I've used "POSTMAN" to run tests, because of my computer is in our Company's Active Directory. 
So I couldn't install JMeter or Apache A/B without Admin permission.

Maybe I've failed in API testing stage, however I'm confident about Selenium Automation side.
And also I'm open minded to learn new things to improve myself. Especially if they are necessariy to maintain my career.

Best regards.
