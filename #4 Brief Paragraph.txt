--- BRIEF PARAGRAPH ---
Selenium Automation
- First of all, the gender radiobutton selection was hard to me. It was always thrown ElementClickInterceptedException.
I've fixed this issue by used execute_script() and presence_of_element_located() methods
- Also it was hard to tackle datepicker element. Actually I wanted to selected random year, month and days in this element.
But it wasn't possible to select random year because of I cannot scroll the year section to up and down.
So I used a static date
- I couldn't handle the Subjects, State and City Listboxes due to I couldn't find these selectors. These selectors
couldn't be tracked on devtools because they were gone when I tried to track them. You can also check this issue on your browser if you want.

API Testing
- I've never used API testing in my proffessional life. So I've searched about this on internet.
- I've used "POSTMAN" to run tests
